🚀 How to Get Started
You can clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the app using the following steps:

🧱 1. Install Frontend/Backend Dependencies
(Open Terminal 1)

npm install
npm install har-validator@latest   # If needed
npm install uuid@latest            # If needed
npm audit fix                      # Optional, to fix vulnerabilities
npm run dev                        # Starts the app on default dev port (e.g., 5173)

🧭 2. Start Prisma Studio
(Open Terminal 2 in parallel)

npx prisma studio

⚙️ Setting Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your own keys (if not already included):

AUTH_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here

✅ Running Tests
Tests are executed using Newman, a CLI tool for running Postman collections. The test flow mimics real API calls — such as validating success codes (200, 201) or failure (404, etc.).

Steps to Run Tests:
1. Start the server
Run in project root:

npm run dev

2. Verify Postman Environment Configuration
Navigate to the postman/environments folder. You’ll find a file like this:

json: 
{
  "key": "baseUrl",
  "value": "http://0.0.0.0:3000",
  "enabled": true
}

⚠️ If your server uses a different port or URL, update baseUrl accordingly.
3. Run Tests

npm run test

You’ll see the test results directly in the terminal. Behind the scenes, this command runs a Postman collection stored in the postman/ folder as defined in your package.json.

⚠️ Important Notes:
Data-sensitive Tests: Some tests use DELETE endpoints, which means they modify the database. Always restart the server (npm run dev) before rerunning tests.

Be cautious with test accounts or sample data, especially if tied to registration/auth endpoints.
